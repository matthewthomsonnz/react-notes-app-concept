# Unique note taking app

Exercise I used to learn React - my own experimental take on a note taking app

# How to use

Click to create note, then start typing. Clicking a note simply deletes it, notes cannot be edited. Change random note colour via div in bottom right.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
